## Inquirable Models
--

The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between complex algorithmic decisions and patient
comprehension and trust by developing a user-interactive risk prediction model. The work seeks
to engineer these interactions with the help of Large Language Models to allow users to query
complex mathematical models using general human language. This approach enhances the
transparency of machine learning models in healthcare and empowers patients with a deeper
understanding of their health risks. By allowing for direct, comprehensible dialogues about
model outputs, we aim to foster trust and provide actionable insights. The project aims to
achieve more informed healthcare decisions and patient-centric care.
